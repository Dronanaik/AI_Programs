# AI Programs - Algorithm Collection

This repository contains classic AI/search algorithms and problem solvers. Each algorithm lives in its own folder with a `README.md` explaining the idea and how to run the code.

## Navigation
- [Breadth-First Search](BreadthFirstSearch/README.md)
- [Depth-First Search](DepthFirstSearch/README.md)
- [N-Queens](NQueens/README.md)
- [8-Puzzle](EightPuzzle/README.md)
- [Tic-Tac-Toe (Minimax)](TicTacToe/README.md)
- [Tower of Hanoi](TowerOfHanoi/README.md)
- [Traveling Salesman Problem](TravelingSalesman/README.md)
- [Water Jug Problem](WaterJugProblem/README.md)
- [Missionaries and Cannibals](MissionariesAndCannibals/README.md)
- [Monkey and Banana](MonkeyBanana/README.md)

## How to run
Each folder links to its `README.md`. Generally you can invoke:

```bash
python3 <folder>/<script>.py
```

Some scripts may accept inputs from the command line or prompt interactively.

## Contribution
- Keep algorithms in their own folders.
- Include a concise `README.md` with: problem statement, approach, complexity, and run instructions.
